# Fundamentals-of-Data-Storage-Practicum

For the Fundamentals of Data Storage Practicum I was tasked with retrieving, loading, and cleaning a dataset. I did so using R code to find and fix errors within the dataset. Data visualizations were also used to aid in identifying errors. 

The dataset that I chose is named Mental_Health_in_Tech_Dataset.xlsx, this is the original excel file with the raw data. This dataset contains data from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. 

This dataset was cleaned and prepared for data analysis in R studio. The accompanying R code is attached in a file named Mental Health in Tech Project.R.
